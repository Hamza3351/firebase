# Firebase + React Native Google Sign-In Demo

This is a quick demo repo showing how to set up Google Sign-In with Firebase Auth in a React Native app. It's super basicâ€”just handles signing in, showing the user, and signing out.

## What It Does
- Renders a Google Sign-In button when not logged in.
- After sign-in, displays a welcome message with the user's email.
- Sign-out button that revokes Google access to avoid auto-selecting the cached account next time.

## Quick Setup

Test on a real device for Google Play Services to work properly. If the account picker doesn't show, check the sign-out logs.
